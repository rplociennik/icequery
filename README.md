icequery
========
[icequery](icequery) is a simple utility for [Icecream](https://github.com/icecc/icecream)
that allows retrieving information about available nodes on the network.
Unlike a full-fledged monitor, such as [Icemon](https://github.com/icecc/icemon), it's a simple
CLI tool allowing it to be easilly incorporated into scripts.
